This project was started May 19th 2025.
The goal of this project is to try writing a renderer on the CPU. This project will allow any user to use the graphics library provided to render a 3D model on their 2D screen complete with textures, shaders, and shadows.
Future ideas include to try using CUDA or OpenCL to parallelize a lot of the matrix arithmetic that is being used.
I'm also planning on adding support to more than just .tga files such as .jpeg or others.
