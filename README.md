This project was started May 19th 2025.
The goal of this project is to try writing a renderer on the CPU. This project will allow any user to use the graphics library provided to render a 3D model on their 2D screen complete with textures, shaders, and shadows.

Items planned for implement (not necessarily in this order):
1.) Using CUDA/OpenCL to parallelize work.
2.) Including support for perspective in 3D grahpics.
3.) Containerizing via Docker
